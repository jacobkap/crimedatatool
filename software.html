      <h1>R Packages</h1>

      <button class="accordion">fastDummies</p></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>The goal of fastDummies is to quickly create dummy variables
          (columns) and dummy rows. Creating dummy variables is possible
          through base R or other packages, but this package is much faster
          than those methods.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Dummy variables (or binary variables) are commonly used in statistical
        analyses and in more simple descriptive statistics. A dummy column is
        one which has a value of one when a categorical event occurs and a
        zero when it doesn’t occur. In most cases this is a feature of the
        event/person/object being described. For example, if the dummy
        variable was for occupation being an R programmer, you can ask,
        “is this person an R programmer?” When the answer is yes, they
        get a value of 1, when it is no, they get a value of 0.</p>

        <br>
        <p>When dealing with data, there are often missing rows. While truly
        handling missing data is far beyond the scope of this package, the
        function dummy_rows() lets you add those missing rows back into the
        data. The function takes all character, factor, and Date columns,
        finds all possible combinations of their values, and adds the
        rows that are not in the original data set. Any columns not used
        in creating the combinations (e.g. numeric) are given a value of
        NA (unless otherwise specified with dummy_value).</p>

      </div>

      <button class="accordion">caesar</p></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>The goal of caesar is to encrypt and decrypt strings using a simple Caesar
        cipher or a pseudorandom number generation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Caesar cipher is an ancient cipher which is made by shifting the
        letters of the alphabet by a set number. So a shift of -3, for example,
        would move each letter to the left by 3, such that A would become X and
        D would become A. For this package it also includes numbers and
        punctuation but the concept is the same.</p>

        <br>
        <p>This method randomizes the alphabet based on a seed you set, making
        it far more secure than the Caesar cipher.</p>

      <button class="accordion">asciiSetupReader</p></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>Some (usually older) data sets are only available in fixed-width
        ASCII files (.txt or .dat) that have an .sps (SPSS) or .sas (SAS)
        setup file explaining to the software how to read that file. These
        file combinations are sometimes referred to as .txt+.sps, .txt+.sas,
        .dat+.sps, .dat+.sas. This package allows you to read in the data
        if you have both the fixed-width file and its accompanying setup file.</p>

      <button class="accordion">meditations</p></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>View the wisdom of Marcus Aurelius through his quotes from his book Meditations.</p>

      <button class="accordion">predictrace</p></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>The goal of race is to predict the race of a surname. This package
        uses U.S. Census data which says how many people of each race has
        a certain surname. From this we can predict which race is mostly
        likely to have that surname. The possible races are American
        Indian, Asian, Black, Hispanic, White, or two or more races.</p>

      <button class="accordion">crimeutils</p></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>The goal of crimeutils is to provide a set of helper functions
        to make common data tasks in criminology research - clean, explore,
        analyze, visualize - a bit easier.</p>

      <button class="accordion">fbi</p></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>The goal of fbi is to connect to the FBI’s Crime Data Explorer to get
        crime data (UCR and NIBRS) from their API.</p>
