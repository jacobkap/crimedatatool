      <div class="panel">
        <p>This site makes it easy for people to analyze crime-related data.
          Select a page in the Data Tool dropdown to look at the type of data
          you're interested in. Most of the data on this site is also
          available to download in full, and for free use (with citation) on
          openICPSR. There are links to the data download page on the Data
          tab of this site. </p>

      <button class="accordion">Who runs this site?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This site is run entirely by me, Jacob Kaplan. I am currently
          a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. I earned
          both my Master's degree and PhD in the crimininology department at
          Penn. My primary research focuses on using quasi-experimental designs
          to quantitatively analyze criminal justice policies. Lately, my
          research portfolio has been focused on the criminology of place,
          specifically on how physical security devices - such as outdoor
          lights - can affect crime. I've also studied a range of topics
          including whether more police officers can reduce crime,
          simulating whether firing "bad apples" will substantially
          reduce complaints against the police, examining public
          perceptions of the accuracy of forensic evidence, and how
          decriminalizing marijuana affects serious domestic violence.
          <br><br>
          I also have significant experience in the programming
          language R and have written the introductory R book
          <a href="https://crimebythenumbers.com/">
            Crime by the Numbers</a> to teach others. I have written several R
          packages including ones that create dummy rows and columns,
          predict race from surnames, handle the FBI's crime data API,
          and read a common data format for government
          data - fixed-width ASCII files - into R.

      <div class="panel">
        <p><b>Yes. It is good practice to cite the data that you use in a
            project or a paper. For the data that I have released on
            openICPSR, the terms of use that you agree to while downloading
            the data require that you cite the data if you use it. Specifically,
            it states "You agree to reference the recommended bibliographic
            citation in any publication that employs resources provided by
            ICPSR." To cite the data, use the citation that is under the
            "Project Citation:" header on the openICPSR page for the data.
            For most of the data you can also look on Google Scholar to

      <div class="panel">
        <p>Some of the data that I've made available, such as NIBRS data, is
          very detailed and includes a number of variables about individuals such
          as the victim and offender of a crime. It <i>may</i> be possible
          to use this to identify the individuals. <b>Do not do this</b> It is
          irresponsible and unethical to try to identify people from this data.
          It is also against the data use agreement you agree to on openICPSR
          to download the data. Specifically, it states that "by downloading
          these data, you hereby agree: "
          To not use these datasets for investigation of specific RESEARCH
          SUBJECTS, except when identification is authorized in writing by

          inadvertently, and to advise ICPSR of any such discovery (help@icpsr.umich.edu)".
          Again, do not even attempt to try to identify any individuals from these data.
          Identifying individuals may lead to interesting research and papers - that

      <button class="accordion">County-level UCR data</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>I have already posted my reasons for why this data should not be
          used in research <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/108164/version/V4/view">
            here</a>. For more extensive documentation on the
          data's issues, please see
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1016060020848">
            this paper</a> by Maltz and Targonski
          from 2002.

      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Analyzing data over time</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Each year of UCR/NIBRS data has different agencies reporting.
          The overall trend is that more agencies report over time, though
          this is not always true (e.g. Florida stopped reporting most data
          in the 1990s). So if you have data that covers more than one year,
          make sure you are only analyzing the same agencies each year.
          Even within the same year some agencies don't report for 12
          months, meaning they are not comparable to agencies that do.
          This likely means removing agencies that don't report every
          month of every year of your study period.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why are there be negative numbers (is this an error)?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Negative numbers can happen in UCR data and are correct, not a
          data issue. UCR data is reported by police monthly and if they
          discover that a previous month was incorrect they don't alter
          the incorrect month to remove that reported crime, they report
          a negative crime in the current month so the annual crime count
          will be correct. For example, consider an agency that reports
          a burglary in January and then in June discover that the burglary
          didn't actually occur. In June they will report -1 burglaries.
          In practice it's rare to see negative numbers since the number
          of actual crimes in a month often outweights the number of corrections,
          but it is possible and is not an error. Converting negative numbers to
          missing values is not correct. See more on pages 82-83
          of the <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/additional-ucr-publications/ucr_handbook.pdf/at_download/file">FBI's
            Manual for UCR data</a>. </p> 
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What is the most common mistake people make
        with this data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Like all data, the data on this site and available to download
          on <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/">openICPSR</a> has flaws. This is
          especially true of the FBI's UCR and NIBRS data available here. The main
          problems with the data is that it only counts reported crime and that
          not all agencies report (and those that do may not report all year).
          However, these are only the technical problems with the data - the bigger
          issue is in how people use it. Each of these issues can be solved - or at least avoided
          in conducting research - and the nuances of each dataset can be handled. However,
          many published articles that I've read either do not address these issues or
          even acknowledge that they exist. There is excellent documentation
          on these datasets in academic articles and in the FBI's manual for the
          data. <b>If you intend to use this data you should read these documents
            (please don't ask me for links to them beyond what I already provide
            on this page) carefully and spend time exploring the data yourself.
            Simply running a regression on the data without fully understanding the
            data is bad research.</b> </p>

      <button class="accordion">Data errors</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>If you believe that you found an error in one of the datasets,
          please read the FBI's manual on that data to ensure it's not a
          known issue or is not an error at all. Common incorrect beliefs
          that something is erroneous are negative numbers in UCR data or
          Florida not appearing for many years in UCR data. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Misspellings in column names</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>I release the data as .dta (Stata) files which has a 32 character
          limit for column names. Therefore I sometimes have to abbreviate
          column names to meet this limit. Most misspellings you see in the
          column names are intentional to meet this requirement.

      <button class="accordion">Source of FIPS codes</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html">
            FIPS codes</a>
          are US Census unique identifiers (within state) for
          geographic areas including state, county, and "place" (i.e. city).
          They are useful when merging with other datasets such as the US Census
          or other government datasets. These identifiers are not in the UCR
          data originally so I added them by merging the UCR data to the
          Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk (LEAIC) that
          <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NACJD/index.html">
            NACJD</a> produced (for more info on this dataset please see
          the Learning Guide on it that I made for NACJD
          <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NACJD/guides/leaic/index.html">
            Here</a>). I merged the LEAIC and UCR data by matching on the ORI
          (unique agency identifier code) variable.

        <p>This data is from the Apparent Per Capita Alcohol Consumption:
          National, State, and Regional Trends
          1977-2016 report produced by Sarah P. Haughwout and Dr. Megan E.
          Slater at the National Institute

        <p>For a complete methodology please see the actual report
          <a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance110/CONS16.htm">here.</a> The
          authors determined the amount of alcohol consumed (originally
          measured in gallons of ethanol
          - pure alcohol) through sales data or tax information for each
          state-year. Population data
          for how many people age 14 and up live in each state was acquired
          from the CDC WONDER data.
          Ethanol was divided by population to determine per capita consumption.

      <button class="accordion">Why is the "Total Drinks" column not equal the
        sum of the individul drink categories?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The original report provides an equation to convert the amount of
          total ethanol consumed into a
          "total drinks" variable so I used that to make that variable. For the
          individual drink categories
          (beer, shots of liquor, and glasses of wine), it provides an equation
          to convert the amount of
          ethanol consumed into the amount of alcohol. I then converted this to
          number of drinks for each
          category based on the National Institute of Health's
          <a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/what-standard-drink">page</a>
          saying how many ounces of alcohol make up a drink for those categories.
          Therefore, the sum of the categories
          is slightly different than the "total drinks" column.

      <button class="accordion">Why did rape go up starting in 2013?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Starting in 2013, rape has a new, broader definition in the UCR to include oral and anal
          penetration (by a body part or object) and allow men to be victims.
          The previous definition included only forcible intercourse against a woman. As this revised
          definition is broader than the original one, more rapes are reported (
          social changes may also be partly responsible as they could encourage victims to report more).
          This definitional change makes post-2013 rape data non-comparable to
          pre-2013 data.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">The data says there were 0 crimes but I know
        that a crime happened. Why does it say 0?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This data doesn't differentiate between a "real zero" and a "not
          reported zero". If an agency
          doesn't report any crimes (even if crimes did occur), the data will
          say zero crimes occurred.
          Even though the data indicates how many months of the year that agency
          reported, that doesn't
          necessarily mean that they reported fully. An agency that reports all
          12 months of the year
          may still report only incomplete data. Agencies can report partial
          data each month and still
          be considered to have reported that month. Chicago, for example,
          reports every month but
          until the last few years didn't report any rapes.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Does this include all crimes reported? (Hierarchy Rule)</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>No, this data only includes the most serious crime in an incident
          (except for motor vehicle
          theft which is always included). For incidents where most the one
          crime happens (for example,
          a robbery and a murder), only the more serious (murder in this case)
          will be counted. This is
          called the Hierarchy Rule. See more on pages 10-12 of the
          <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/additional-ucr-publications/ucr_handbook.pdf/at_download/file">FBI's
            Manual for UCR data</a> which details the Hierarchy Rule.

      <button class="accordion">If this data only includes the most serious crime in an incident,
        how reliable is the data? (Does the Hierarchy Rule mess up our data?)</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Though the Hierarchy Rule does mean this data is an undercount, data
          from other sources
          indicate it isn't much of an undercount. The FBI's other data set,
          the National Inicident-Based
          Reporting System (NIBRS) contains every crime that occurs in an
          incident (i.e. it doesn't
          use the Hierarchy Rule). Using this we can measure how many crimes
          the Hierarchy Rule excludes
          (Most major cities do not report to NIBRS so what we find in NIBRS
          may not apply to them).
          In over 90% of incidents, only one crime is committed. Additionally,
          when people talk about
          "crime" they usually mean murder which, while incomplete to discuss
          crime, means the UCR
          data here is accurate on that measure.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What about crimes not reported to the police?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>A major limitation (in my opinion the most important limitation) to the data here is that it
          doesn't include crimes not reported to police. Based on victimization surveys that ask people
          both if they were victimized and if they reported that crime, we know that the majority of
          crimes are not reported. This probably won't matter when looking at a single city for a short
          period of time - the population won't change too much so even underreporting of crime will be
          consistent underreporting. The issue becomes serious when looking at a city with major population
          changes or comparing multiple cities as their population may have very different reporting
          practices. There's no easy solution here but it is an important aspect of understanding crime
          data that you should keep in mind. For a full breakdown of reporting rates broken down by
          crime and a number of characteristics about the crime and victim (and reasons for not
          reporting), see Tables 91-105 (pages 98-114) in <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus08.pdf">
            this report on the National Crime Victmization Survey from 2008.</a></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Should I use the crime count or crime rate?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Using the rate helps deal with population changes that could lead to changes in crime merely
          because of that change but it isn't without its drawbacks. The main drawback with using a
          rate is that it assumes equal risk of victimization, which we know isn't correct. For example,
          when looking at rape, a crime that affects 6 times as many women as men (according to the
          <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv16re.pdf">2016 National Crime Victimation
            Survey Table 6, page 9</a>), yet the rate is based on total population in that city
          (the UCR does not differentiate victims by gender but other data sets, such as NIBRS
          do, allowing for better rates.). Other crimes require even more granular rates. Murder
          victims are predominantly young men, but this differs by type of murder - domestic
          violence victims are mostly women. Also, consider that population comes from those who
          live in the city and doesn't include people like tourists or people who work in that
          city but live elsewhere yet can still be victimized in the city. So while rates are
          probably better than counts as it lets you control for population, consider exactly
          who that population is, and how risk changes within that population.

      <button class="accordion">What are index crimes?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Index crimes (sometimes called Part I crimes) are a collection of eight crimes often divided
          between Violent Index Crimes (murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault (assault with a
          weapon or causing serious bodily injury)) and Property Index Crimes (burglary, theft, motor
          vehicle theft, and arson (however arson is not available in this data set)). When people discuss
          "crime" they are often referring to this collection of crimes. One major drawback of this is
          that it gives equal weight to each crimes. For example, consider if New York City has 100 fewer
          murders and 100 more thefts this year than last year (and all other crimes didn't change). Their
          total index crimes would be the same but this year would be far safer than last year. For complete
          definitions of each crime, please see the FBI's <a href="https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/offenses.cfm">definitions page.</a></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why are index crimes a poor measure of crime?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The biggest problem with index crimes is that it is simply the sum
          of 8 (or 7 since arson data usually isn't available) crimes.
          Index crimes have a huge range in their seriousness - it includes
          both murder and theft.This is clearly wrong as
          100 murders is more serious than 100 thefts. This is especially a
          problem as less serious crimes (theft mostly) are far more
          common than more serious crimes (in 2017 there were 1.25 million violent
          index crimes in the United States. That same year had 5.5 million thefts.).
          So index crimes undercount the seriousness of crimes. Looking at total
          index crimes is, in effect, mostly just looking at theft.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is especially a problem because it hide trends in violent crimes.
          San Francisco, as an example, has had a huge increase in
          index crimes in the last several years. When looking closer, that
          increase is driven almost entirely by the near doubling of theft since 2011. During
          the same years, violent crime has stayed fairly steady. So the city
          isn't getting more dangerous but it appears like it is due to just looking at
          total index crimes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>While many researchers divide index crimes into violent and nonviolent
          categories, which helps but even this isn't entirely sufficient.
          Take Chicago as an example. It is a city infamous for its large number
          of murders. But as a fraction of
          index crimes, Chicago has a rounding error worth of murders. Their 653
          murders in 2017 is only 0.5% of total index crimes. For violent index crimes,
          murder makes up 2.2%. What this means is that changes in murder are very
          difficult to detect. If Chicago had no murders this year, but a less
          serious crime (such as theft) increased
          slightly, we couldn't tell from looking at the number of index crimes.

        <blockquote>The rates of almost all causes of disease, injury, and death vary by age. Age
          adjustment is a technique for "removing" the effects of age from crude rates so as to
          allow meaningful comparisons across populations with different underlying age structures.
          For example, comparing the crude rate of heart disease in Florida with that of California
          is misleading, because the relatively older population in Florida leads to a higher crude
          death rate, even if the age-specific rates of heart disease in Florida and California were
          the same. For such a comparison, age-adjusted rates are preferable. </blockquote>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>This dataset is the most flawed of all of the UCR datasets.
          While the main problems are simply an exacerbated version of
          of dataset problems in other UCR data - low reporting rates among agencies,
          only including reported crimes (and many hate crimes are not reported to police),
          changing definitions of what counts as a hate crime, different agencies
          reporting each year - the MAJOR problem is that people use this data
          incredibly irresponsibly. A huge amount of research using this data
          don't even acknowledge these problems and just naively use the data as
          if it had no issues. The problems are discussed in more detail below but
          the main takeaway is that this data is not appropriate for policy analysis. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Where is the FBI manual on this data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The manual is available on

      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What is a hate crime?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>In this data a hate crime is defined as a "normal" crime (or in
          other words a crime already collected by UCR or NIBRS in their
          normal reporting) where the victim was chosen because of the victims
          group or status. For example, vandalism is a crime already included
          in NIBRS data. If the vandalism occurred because of the victim's group
          or status, such as vandalizing a synagogue due to bias against Jews, that
          would be considered a hate crime. Animal cruelty was not a NIBRS crime
          until 2018 so for years prior to that would not count as a hate crime. For
          example, if a person poisoned a Black person's dog because of their bias against
          Black people (and not just personal opposition towards this individual), it would
          not be a hate crime if committed before 2018. So this data is not inclusive of
          even all hate crimes reported to police, only ones that have a crime type already
          reported to the FBI. Note that the hate crime is for the perceived victim
          group even if that perception is wrong. In the FBI manual they
          give the example of a hate crime against an Indian man who the offenders
          believe is Black. This is reported as an anti-Black hate crime. </p>

      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What should this data be used for?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The only thing you should do to use this data properly is
          look at hate crimes of the same bias motivation (e.g. anti-Jewish,
          anti-Black) in the same agency over time (assuming the agency reports
          the same months each year) and assuming that the bias motivation
          has been reported by that agency every year. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Is it a good idea to aggregate over geographies?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>No. The problem with this is that few agencies report so aggregating
          would exclude a lot of agencies that are actually in that geography
          but don't report. To my opinion there is no good way to impute missing
          hate crime data so any attempt to do so will be very flawed and give incorrect
          results. Every year when the FBI releases the report on this data the news
          and many academics will just aggregate all reporting agencies to the national
          level (ignoring all the missing agencies) and pretend that this is an
          accurate count of national hate crimes. This
          is a terrible idea and gives very inaccurate counts of hate crimes. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Is it a good idea to compare hate crimes
        across agencies?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>No. Not all agencies report for all months of the year or even for
          all bias motivations so they're often not comparable. Additionally,
          since the opportunity to commit a hate crime (i.e. the number of people
          of a particular victim group) differs between cities, differences across
          cities in hate crimes may be due to differences in opportunity, not hate. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Is it a good idea to compare hate crimes
        across time?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Generally no. The FBI has added new bias motivations over time
          so there is artificially an increase in hate crimes just due to this.
          For example, if 10 transgender people (one of the bias motivations
          that hasn't always been included as a reportable bias motivation) are always
          the victim of a hate crime in a particular agency, the year that this becomes
          an accepted motivation, the agency starts reporting an extra 10 hate crimes
          per year. But in reality hate crime was consistent across time. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why do some bias motivations have zero for many
        years then start having hate crimes?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>There are three reasons this could be. First, the agency may have
          gotten reports but not submitted hate crimes of those bias motivations.
          Second, they may have never received a complaint for this bias motivation
          prior to this year. Third, the FBI has increased the number of bias motivations
          they accepted so this may be one of this bias motivations. Prior to the
          accepted year, these would always be marked as zero reports. Note that in these
          cases not all agencies start reporting these motivations in the same year as
          the FBI accepts them. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Are police agencies required to submit this data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>No, reporting this data, like all UCR data, is voluntary. Some states
          do require that their agencys report UCR data but this is no national
          requirement. And even in these mandatory states not all agencies report.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Are hate crimes a good measure of hate?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>No, like all crimes hate crimes are dependent on opportunity - though
          hate crimes have more variation in opportunity than other crimes.
          Consider, for example, a city with 10% Black population and one with 50%
          Black population. If anti-Black sentiment and willingness to attack
          Black people for their race is the same in each city, in the second city
          there is about five times as many opportunities as in the first cities
          to offend. So even if anti-Black hate is identical in both cities, we'd
          expect there to be many more anti-Black hate crimes in the second city. This can
          be particially alleviated by using rates per victim group using Census data but
          that's still flawed since you'd likely only get decennial Census data and the Census
          doesn't collect all victim type info.</p>

        <blockquote>As states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons increased their

          asking states to report a count of inmates under the jurisdiction or
          legal authority of state and federal adult correctional officials in
          addition to their custody counts.
          Since 1977, the jurisdiction count has been the preferred measure.
          This count includes all state and federal inmates held in a public or
          private prison (custody) and those held in jail facilities either
          physically located inside or outside of the state of legal responsibility, and
          other inmates who may be temporarily out to court or in transit from
          the jurisdiction of legal authority to the custody of a confinement
          facility outside that jurisdiction.
          The difference between the total custody count and the jurisdiction
          count was small (approximately 7,000) when both were first
          collected in 1977. As more states began to report jurisdiction counts
          and more states began to rely on local and privately operated
          facilities to house inmates, the difference increased. At yearend
          2016 the jurisdiction population totaled 1,506,800 while the custody

      <div class="panel">
        <p>All of this data comes from the Department of Education Office of
          Postsecondary Education which collects crime data from colleges and
          releases them publicly. Their website is
          <a href="https://ope.ed.gov/campussafety/#/">here</a>. While their
          site does allow you to look at a single
          school's data, it only shows the prior three years and only as tables.

      <button class="accordion">Why don't crime categories overlap between
        crimes and arrests?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>There are different rules for which offenses are included when

        <p>There are different rules for which offenses are included when an
          offense is committed and a disciplinary actions are taken so these categories
          do not necessarily overlap. As sexual offenses are not included in

      <button class="accordion">Are hate crimes consistently reported?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>No, the hate crime data unwent a series of changes in how the data
          was collected. The crimes theft, intimidation, and
          vandalism/destruction of property
          only started being reported in 2009. Starting in 2014, "gender identity"
          was added as a possible bias motivation while in the same
          year the "ethnicity or national origin" bias motivation was split into
          either "ethnicity" or "national origin" bias motivations.
          This means that you should be cautious when looking at total hate crime
          changes as certain crimes/bias motivations were not included until recently. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why are there no rapes before 2014?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This data set did not collect information on the number of rape,
          fondling, incest, or statutory rape crimes until 2014.
          Instead, it grouped rape and fondling as Sexual Offense - Forcible,
          and incest and statutory rape as Sexual Offense - Non-forcible.

      <button class="accordion">Is rate per 1,000 students a good measure?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Using rates is useful as it removes the important influence of the
          number of people at that school, but has its own serious limitations.
          Schools with similar number of students may still be very different
          in their student population and risk of victimization. Consider, for example,
          two schools which each have 20,000 students. If these two schools are
          very similar in students, then the rate per 1,000 students could be useful
          in comparing the schools are the groups are similar. If, however these
          schools differ on factors such as if the school is urban, whether
          students commute or
          live on campus, ages of students, etc, then knowing purely the number
          of students is not a very useful rate. Also consider that crimes can
          occur against victims
          other than students such as faculty or staff so a per 1,000 student
          rate would overestimate crime by decreasing the denominator. </p>
      </div>


      <button class="accordion">Are changes in crimes a reflection of actual
        changes in offenses, or changes in reporting?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Like all crime data, this data has a limitation as it is reported
          offenses only. If likelihood of reporting changes, that will
          be reflected in changes of reported offenses but we will not be able
          to tell (based only on this data) whether it was the number
          of crimes or the likelihood of reporting that changed. This is
          especially a problem with sexual offenses as they are already were
          unlikely to be reported and small changes in reporting likelihood
          can cause a seemingly large change in crimes reported. Also keep in mind
          that the population included (primarily college students) may have
          different reporting likelihoods than other populations.</p>
