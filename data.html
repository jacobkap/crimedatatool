      <button class="accordion">What should I do if I have a question?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>If you have a question you can email me at jkkaplan6@gmail.com.
          <b>I get a lot of requests and unfortunately can't respond to all of them,
            especially around data quality issues in the underlying data. I
            will not respond to questions sent to my Penn email.</b> 
          Questions that you would ask a co-author - such as how to properly handle
          missing data or how I would approach a research problem - are generally
          outside the scope of a question that I'll answer.
          If you require more detailed help than an brief email response or are
          interested in working with me on data or research, email me to
          discuss the project, timeline, and other relevant information.
          Make sure your email specifies what the project is, what part
          I would do, who else is involved, and a timeline for project
          completion (or at least my part of the project). 
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Am I required to cite this data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p><b>Yes. It is good practice to cite the data that you use in a
            project or a paper. For the data that I have released, the terms of use
            that you agree to while requesting
            the data require that you cite the data if you use it. The data use license
            also requires that you cite it. To cite the data, use the citation that is included
            in the Google Drive folder for the data. The citation file is
            also available in the zip folder for the files.</b></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Am I required to release replication code or data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p><b>Yes. You must agree to release
            public replication code and data for any published work you make using any of these data.
            This is a requirement both in the Google Form you fill out to access the data and in the
            data use license for the data.</b></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What if I don't want to release replication code or data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p><b>Then you cannot use any of my data. You must agree to release
            public replication code and data for any published work you make using any of these data.
            This is a requirement both in the Google Form you fill out to access the data and in the
            data use license for the data. </b></p>
      </div>


      <button class="accordion">Attempting to identify people from data</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Some of the data available is
          very detailed and includes a number of variables about individuals such
          as the victim and offender of a crime. It <i>may</i> be possible
          to use this to identify the individuals. <b>Do not do this.</b> It is
          irresponsible and unethical to try to identify people from this data.
          It is also against the data use agreement you agree to on openICPSR
          to download the data. Specifically, it states that "by downloading
          these data, you hereby agree: "
          To not use these datasets for investigation of specific RESEARCH
          SUBJECTS, except when identification is authorized in writing by
          ICPSR (help@icpsr.umich.edu) [and]
          To make no use of the identity of any RESEARCH SUBJECT discovered
          inadvertently, and to advise ICPSR of any such discovery (help@icpsr.umich.edu)".
          Again, do not even attempt to try to identify any individuals from these data.
          Identifying individuals may lead to interesting research and papers - that
          is no excuse, don't do it.
