      <button class="accordion">What should I do if I have a question?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>If you have a quick question you can email me at jacob@crimedatatool.com.
          If you require more detailed help than an email response or are
          interested in working with me on data or research, email me to
          discuss the project, timeline, and other relevant information.
          Make sure your email specifies what the project is, what part
          I would do, who else is involved, and a timeline for project
          completion (or at least my part of the project). </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Am I required to cite this data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Yes. It is good practice to cite the data that you use in a
          project or a paper. For the data that I have released on
          openICPSR, the terms of use that you agree to while downloading
          the data require that you cite the data if you use it. Specifically,
          it states "You agree to reference the recommended bibliographic
          citation in any publication that employs resources provided by
          ICPSR." To cite the data, use the citation that is under the
          "Project Citation:" header on the openICPSR page for the data.
          For most of the data you can also look on Google Scholar to
          find the BibTeX, EndNote, RefMan, or RefWorks citation
          shortcuts there.  </p>
      </div>


      <button class="accordion">Will more data (or new years of current data)
        be added to openICPSR?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The short answer is no. The long answer is that it takes a very long time
          to clean data and make sure the data is correct (i.e. no issues in my code
          or in the underlying data). So there are no guarantees that I will add any
          new data or even update data when new data is released.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Will this site be updated/Will more data be added?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The short answer is no. The long answer is that it takes a very long time
          to clean data that I would like to add to the site and then make a page to display
          that data. I will likely keep this site updated to fix bugs but can't guarantee making any changes or
          adding any specific data just due to the time it takes and the lack of time I have now.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">County-level UCR data:</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>I have already posted my reasons for why this data should not be
          used in research <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/108164/version/V4/view">
            here</a>. For more extensive documentation on the
          data's issues, please see
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1016060020848">

      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Analyzing data over time</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Each year of UCR/NIBRS data has different agencies reporting.
          The overall trend is that more agencies report over time, though
          this is not always true (e.g. Florida stopped reporting most data
          in the 1990s). So if you have data that covers more than one year,
          make sure you are only analyzing the same agencies each year.
          Even within the same year some agencies don't report for 12
          months, meaning they are not comparable to agencies that do.
          This likely means removing agencies that don't report every
          month of every year of your study period.
        </p>

      <button class="accordion">Data errors</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>If you believe that you found an error in one of the datasets,
          please read the FBI's manual on that data to ensure it's not a
          known issue or is not an error at all. Common incorrect beliefs
          that something is erroneous are negative numbers in UCR data or
          Florida not appearing for many years in UCR data.
