        <p>If you have a question you can email me at jkkaplan6@gmail.com.
          <b>I get a lot of requests and unfortunately can't respond to all of them,
            especially around data quality issues in the underlying data. I
            will not respond to questions sent to my Penn email.</b> 
          Questions that you would ask a co-author - such as how to properly handle
          missing data or how I would approach a research problem - are generally
          outside the scope of a question that I'll answer.
          If you require more detailed help than an brief email response or are
          interested in working with me on data or research, email me to
          discuss the project, timeline, and other relevant information.
          Make sure your email specifies what the project is, what part
          I would do, who else is involved, and a timeline for project
          completion (or at least my part of the project).

      <button class="accordion">Am I required to cite this data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p><b>Yes. It is good practice to cite the data that you use in a
            project or a paper. For the data that I have released on
            openICPSR, the terms of use that you agree to while downloading
            the data require that you cite the data if you use it. Specifically,
            it states "You agree to reference the recommended bibliographic
            citation in any publication that employs resources provided by
            ICPSR." To cite the data, use the citation that is under the
            "Project Citation:" header on the openICPSR page for the data.
            For most of the data you can also look on Google Scholar to
            find the BibTeX, EndNote, RefMan, or RefWorks citation
            shortcuts there.</b></p>
      </div>


      <button class="accordion">Attempting to identify people from data</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Some of the data available is
          very detailed and includes a number of variables about individuals such
          as the victim and offender of a crime. It <i>may</i> be possible
          to use this to identify the individuals. <b>Do not do this.</b> It is
          irresponsible and unethical to try to identify people from this data.
          It is also against the data use agreement you agree to on openICPSR
          to download the data. Specifically, it states that "by downloading
          these data, you hereby agree: "
          To not use these datasets for investigation of specific RESEARCH
          SUBJECTS, except when identification is authorized in writing by

          To make no use of the identity of any RESEARCH SUBJECT discovered
          inadvertently, and to advise ICPSR of any such discovery (help@icpsr.umich.edu)".
          Again, do not even attempt to try to identify any individuals from these data.
          Identifying individuals may lead to interesting research and papers - that
          is no excuse, don't do it.

      <button class="accordion">County-level UCR data</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>I have already posted my reasons for why this data should not be
          used in research <a href="https://ucrbook.com/county-level-ucr-data.html">
            here</a>. For more extensive documentation on the
          data's issues, please see
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1016060020848">
            this paper</a> by Maltz and Targonski
          from 2002.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Analyzing data over time</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Each year of UCR/NIBRS data has different agencies reporting.
          The overall trend is that more agencies report over time, though
          this is not always true (e.g. Florida stopped reporting most data
          in the 1990s). So if you have data that covers more than one year,
          make sure you are only analyzing the same agencies each year.
          Even within the same year some agencies don't report for 12
          months, meaning they are not comparable to agencies that do.
          This likely means removing agencies that don't report every
          month of every year of your study period.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why are there be negative numbers
         (is this an error)?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Negative numbers can happen in UCR data and are correct, not a
          data issue. UCR data is reported by police monthly and if they
          discover that a previous month was incorrect they don't alter
          the incorrect month to remove that reported crime, they report
          a negative crime in the current month so the annual crime count
          will be correct. For example, consider an agency that reports
          a burglary in January and then in June discover that the burglary
          didn't actually occur. In June they will report -1 burglaries.
          In practice it's rare to see negative numbers since the number
          of actual crimes in a month often outweights the number of corrections,
          but it is possible and is not an error. Converting negative numbers to
          missing values is not correct. See more on pages 82-83
          of the <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/additional-ucr-publications/ucr_handbook.pdf/at_download/file">FBI's
            Manual for UCR data</a>. </p> 
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What is the most common mistake people make
        with this data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Like all data, the data on this site and available to download
          on <a href="openicpsr.org/">openICPSR</a> has flaws. This is
          especially true of the FBI's UCR and NIBRS data available here. The main
          problems with the data is that it only counts reported crime and that
          not all agencies report (and those that do may not report all year).
          However, these are only the technical problems with the data - the bigger
          issue is in how people use it. Each of these issues can be solved - or at least avoided
          in conducting research - and the nuances of each dataset can be handled. However,
          many published articles that I've read either do not address these issues or
          even acknowledge that they exist. There is excellent documentation
          on these datasets in academic articles and in the FBI's manual for the
          data. <b>If you intend to use this data you should read these documents
            (please don't ask me for links to them beyond what I already provide
            on this page) carefully and spend time exploring the data yourself.
            Simply running a regression on the data without fully understanding the
            data is bad research.</b> </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Data errors</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>If you believe that you found an error in one of the datasets,
          please read the FBI's manual on that data to ensure it's not a
          known issue or is not an error at all. Common incorrect beliefs
          that something is erroneous are negative numbers in UCR data or
          Florida not appearing for many years in UCR data. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Misspellings in column names</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>I release the data as .dta (Stata) files which has a 32 character
          limit for column names. Therefore I sometimes have to abbreviate
          column names to meet this limit. Most misspellings you see in the
          column names are intentional to meet this requirement.

      <button class="accordion">Source of FIPS codes</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html">
            FIPS codes</a>
          are US Census unique identifiers (within state) for
          geographic areas including state, county, and "place" (i.e. city).
          They are useful when merging with other datasets such as the US Census
          or other government datasets. These identifiers are not in the UCR
          data originally so I added them by merging the UCR data to the
          Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk (LEAIC) that
          <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NACJD/index.html">
            NACJD</a> produced (for more info on this dataset please see
          the Learning Guide on it that I made for NACJD
          <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NACJD/guides/leaic/index.html">
            Here</a>). I merged the LEAIC and UCR data by matching on the ORI
          (unique agency identifier code) variable.
