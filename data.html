      <button class="accordion">What is this site?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This site makes it easy for people to analyze crime-related data.
          Select a page in the Data Tool dropdown to look at the type of data
          you're interested in. Most of the data on this site is also
          available to download in full, and for free use (with citation) on
          openICPSR. There are links to the data download page on the Data
          tab of this site. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Who runs this site?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This site is run entirely by me, Jacob Kaplan. I am currently
          a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. I earned
          both my Master's degree and PhD in the crimininology department at
          Penn. My primary research focuses on using quasi-experimental designs
          to quantitatively analyze criminal justice policies. Lately, my
          research portfolio has been focused on the criminology of place,
          specifically on how physical security devices - such as outdoor
          lights - can affect crime. I've also studied a range of topics
          including whether more police officers can reduce crime,
          simulating whether firing "bad apples" will substantially
          reduce complaints against the police, examining public
          perceptions of the accuracy of forensic evidence, and how
          decriminalizing marijuana affects serious domestic violence.

          I also have significant experience in the programming
          language R and have written the introductory R book
          <a href="https://crimebythenumbers.com/">
            Crime by the Numbers</a> to teach others. I have written several R
          packages including ones that create dummy rows and columns,
          predict race from surnames, handle the FBI's crime data API,
          and read a common data format for government
          data - fixed-width ASCII files - into R.

          I've made over a dozen crime datasets available to the public on
          the data repository website openICPSR.org. By webscraping, PDF scraping,
          and developing an R package to read in ASCII files (which all FBI data
          comes as) - and cleaning the data - these data save researchers time
          they would have spend doing this work themselves and making the data
          available to people without the time or skills to do this work.
          This data work has been used in dozens of peer-reviewed journal
          articles and downloaded over 5,000 times.

      <button class="accordion">What should I do if I have a question?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>If you have a quick question you can email me at jacob@crimedatatool.com.
          Questions that you would ask a co-author - such as how to properly handle
          missing data or how to approach a research problem - are generally
          outside the scope of a quick question.
          If you require more detailed help than an email response or are
          interested in working with me on data or research, email me to
          discuss the project, timeline, and other relevant information.
          Make sure your email specifies what the project is, what part
          I would do, who else is involved, and a timeline for project
          completion (or at least my part of the project). </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Am I required to cite this data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Yes. It is good practice to cite the data that you use in a
          project or a paper. For the data that I have released on
          openICPSR, the terms of use that you agree to while downloading
          the data require that you cite the data if you use it. Specifically,
          it states "You agree to reference the recommended bibliographic
          citation in any publication that employs resources provided by
          ICPSR." To cite the data, use the citation that is under the
          "Project Citation:" header on the openICPSR page for the data.
          For most of the data you can also look on Google Scholar to
          find the BibTeX, EndNote, RefMan, or RefWorks citation
          shortcuts there.  </p>
      </div>


      <button class="accordion">Will more data (or new years of current data)
        be added to openICPSR?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The short answer is no. The long answer is that it takes a very long time
          to clean data and make sure the data is correct (i.e. no issues in my code
          or in the underlying data). So there are no guarantees that I will add any
          new data or even update data when new data is released.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Will this site be updated/Will more data be added?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The short answer is no. The long answer is that it takes a very long time
          to clean data that I would like to add to the site and then make a page to display

          there are no guarantees that I will add any
          new data or even update data when new data is released.</p>

      <button class="accordion">County-level UCR data:</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>I have already posted my reasons for why this data should not be
          used in research <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/108164/version/V4/view">
            here</a>. For more extensive documentation on the
          data's issues, please see
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1016060020848">
            this paper</a> by Maltz and Targonski
          from 2002.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Analyzing data over time</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Each year of UCR/NIBRS data has different agencies reporting.
          The overall trend is that more agencies report over time, though
          this is not always true (e.g. Florida stopped reporting most data
          in the 1990s). So if you have data that covers more than one year,
          make sure you are only analyzing the same agencies each year.
          Even within the same year some agencies don't report for 12
          months, meaning they are not comparable to agencies that do.
          This likely means removing agencies that don't report every
          month of every year of your study period.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why are there be negative numbers (is this an error)?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Negative numbers can happen in UCR data and are correct, not a
          data issue. UCR data is reported by police monthly and if they
          discover that a previous month was incorrect they don't alter
          the incorrect month to remove that reported crime, they report
          a negative crime in the current month so the annual crime count
          will be correct. For example, consider an agency that reports
          a burglary in January and then in June discover that the burglary
          didn't actually occur. In June they will report -1 burglaries.
          In practice it's rare to see negative numbers since the number
          of actual crimes in a month often outweights the number of corrections,
          but it is possible and is not an error. Converting negative numbers to
          missing values is not correct. See more on pages 82-83
          of the <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/additional-ucr-publications/ucr_handbook.pdf/at_download/file">FBI's
            Manual for UCR data</a>. </p> 
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What is the most common mistake people make
        with this data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Like all data, the data on this site and available to download
          on <a href="openicpsr.org/">openicpsr.org/</a> has flaws. This is
          especially true of the FBI's UCR and NIBRS data available here. The main
          problems with the data is that it only counts reported crime and that
          not all agencies report (and those that do may not report all year).
          However, these are only the technical problems with the data - the bigger
          issue is in how people use it. Each of these issues can be solved - or at least avoided
          in conducting research - and the nuances of each dataset can be handled. However,
          many published articles that I've read either do not address these issues or
          even acknowledge that they exist. There is excellent documentation
          on these datasets in academic articles and in the FBI's manual for the
          data. <b>If you intend to use this data you should read these documents
            (please don't ask me for links to them beyond what I already provide
            on this page) carefully and spend time exploring the data yourself.
            Simply running a regression on the data without fully understanding the
            data is bad research.</b> </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Data errors</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>If you believe that you found an error in one of the datasets,
          please read the FBI's manual on that data to ensure it's not a
          known issue or is not an error at all. Common incorrect beliefs
          that something is erroneous are negative numbers in UCR data or
          Florida not appearing for many years in UCR data. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Misspellings in column names</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>I release the data as .dta (Stata) files which has a 32 character
          limit for column names. Therefore I sometimes have to abbreviate
          column names to meet this limit. Most misspellings you see in the
          column names are intentional to meet this requirement.
