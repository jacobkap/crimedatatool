      <button class="accordion">What should I do if I have a question?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>If you have a question you can email me at jkkaplan6@gmail.com.
          <b>I get a lot of requests and unfortunately can't respond to all of them,
            especially around data quality issues in the underlying data. I
            will not respond to questions sent to my Penn email.</b> 
          Questions that you would ask a co-author - such as how to properly handle
          missing data or how I would approach a research problem - are generally
          outside the scope of a question that I'll answer.
          If you require more detailed help than an brief email response or are
          interested in working with me on data or research, email me to
          discuss the project, timeline, and other relevant information.
          Make sure your email specifies what the project is, what part
          I would do, who else is involved, and a timeline for project
          completion (or at least my part of the project). 
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Am I required to cite this data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p><b>Yes. It is good practice to cite the data that you use in a
            project or a paper. For the data that I have released on
            openICPSR, the terms of use that you agree to while downloading
            the data require that you cite the data if you use it. Specifically,
            it states "You agree to reference the recommended bibliographic
            citation in any publication that employs resources provided by
            ICPSR." To cite the data, use the citation that is under the
            "Project Citation:" header on the openICPSR page for the data.
            For most of the data you can also look on Google Scholar to
            find the BibTeX, EndNote, RefMan, or RefWorks citation
            shortcuts there.</b></p>
      </div>


      <button class="accordion">Attempting to identify people from data</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Some of the data available is
          very detailed and includes a number of variables about individuals such
          as the victim and offender of a crime. It <i>may</i> be possible
          to use this to identify the individuals. <b>Do not do this.</b> It is
          irresponsible and unethical to try to identify people from this data.
          It is also against the data use agreement you agree to on openICPSR
          to download the data. Specifically, it states that "by downloading
          these data, you hereby agree: "
          To not use these datasets for investigation of specific RESEARCH
          SUBJECTS, except when identification is authorized in writing by
          ICPSR (help@icpsr.umich.edu) [and]
          To make no use of the identity of any RESEARCH SUBJECT discovered
          inadvertently, and to advise ICPSR of any such discovery (help@icpsr.umich.edu)".
          Again, do not even attempt to try to identify any individuals from these data.
          Identifying individuals may lead to interesting research and papers - that
          is no excuse, don't do it.
