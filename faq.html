      <button class="accordion">What should I do if I have a question about data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>If you have a question you can email me at jacob@crimedatatool.com. I have a lot
          of data sets available (and some overlap in variables) so please link the openICPSR URL
          of the data set you have questions about. That'll help me know which data you are
          asking about and which version of that data you are using (I recommend using the latest version available). </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Will this site be updated/Will more data be added?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The short answer is no. The long answer is that it takes a very long time
          to clean data that I would like to add to the site and then make a page to display
          that data. I will likely keep this site updated but can't guarantee making any changes or
          adding any specific data just due to the time it takes and the lack of time I have now. For data already
          on the site I'll make sure to update to the latest year of data available (if I don't please email me to remind me!). </p>

      <h1>Alcohol</h1>

      <button class="accordion">Where is the data from?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This data is from the Apparent Per Capita Alcohol Consumption: National, State, and Regional Trends
          1977-2016 report produced by Sarah P. Haughwout and Dr. Megan E. Slater at the National Institute
          on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. The Data page of this site has a link to download he data. For the
          original report, click <a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance110/CONS16.htm">here</a></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">How was per capita alcohol consumption determined?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>For a complete methodology please see the actual report
          <a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance110/CONS16.htm">here.</a> The
          authors determined the amount of alcohol consumed (originally measured in gallons of ethanol
          - pure alcohol) through sales data or tax information for each state-year. Population data
          for how many people age 14 and up live in each state was acquired from the CDC' WONDER data.
          Ethanol was divided by population to determine per capita consumption. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why is the "Total Drinks" column not equal the sum of the individul drink categories?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The original report provides an equation to convert the amount of total ethanol consumed into a
          "total drinks" variable so I used that to make that variable. For the individual drink categories
          (beer, shots of liquor, and glasses of wine), it provides an equation to convert the amount of
          ethanol consumed into the amount of alcohol. I then converted this to number of drinks for each
          category based on the National Institute of Health's
          <a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/what-standard-drink">page</a>
          saying how many ounces of alcohol make up a drink for those categories. Therefore, the sum of the categories
          is slightly different than the "total drinks" column.</p>
      </div>

      <h1>Arrest</h1>

      <button class="accordion">Where is the data from?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This data is from the FBI's Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race data which is part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program.
          This data provides the number of arrests that occurred in a city in any given year and breaks that down by age
          (adult or juvenile), race, and gender. </a></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why does it say 'cannabis' instead of 'marijuana'?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>I try to keep data on this site consistent with the data I have published on openICPSR and I
          call it 'cannabis' there. I do so only because the programming language Stata limits columns to 32 characters
          and 'cannabis' is a shorter word than 'marijuana'. </a></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why doesn't it show arrests by ethnicity (Hispanic/Not Hispanic)?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This data does not show arrests broken down by if the arrestee is Hispanic or not. </a></p>

      <h1>Crime</h1>

      <button class="accordion">Where is the data from?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This data is from the FBI's Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest data which is part of the
          Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. This data provides the number of crimes that occurred
          in a city in any given year and how many of those crimes were cleared.</a></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why are there negative numbers? Is that a mistake?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Negative values reflect adjustments of previous returns. So if the agency reports, for example,
          a burglary in January then in February discovers that it wasn't actually a burglary, they
          will record that both as 1 unfounded burglary and -1 actual burglary in February. This is
          so it "deletes" the erroneously recorded burglary from January. See more on pages 82-83
          of the <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/additional-ucr-publications/ucr_handbook.pdf/at_download/file">FBI's
            Manual for UCR data</a>. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why did rape go up starting in 2013?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Starting in 2013, rape has a new, broader definition in the UCR to include oral and anal
          penetration (by a body part or object) and allow men to be victims.
          The previous definition included only forcible intercourse against a woman. As this revised
          definition is broader than the original one, more rapes are reported (
          social changes may also be partly responsible as they could encourage victims to report more).
          This definitional change makes post-2013 rape data non-comparable to
          pre-2013 data.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">The data says there were 0 crimes but I know that a crime happened. Why does it say 0?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This data doesn't differentiate between a "real zero" and a "not reported zero". If an agency
          doesn't report any crimes (even if crimes did occur), the data will say zero crimes occurred.
          Even though the data indicates how many months of the year that agency reported, that doesn't
          necessarily mean that they reported fully. An agency that reports all 12 months of the year
          may still report only incomplete data. Agencies can report partial data each month and still
          be considered to have reported that month. Chicago, for example, reports every month but
          until the last few years didn't report any rapes.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Does this include all crimes reported? (Hierarchy Rule)</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>No, this data only includes the most serious crime in an incident (except for motor vehicle
          theft which is always included). For incidents where most the one crime happens (for example,
          a robbery and a murder), only the more serious (murder in this case) will be counted. This is
          called the Hierarchy Rule. See more on pages 10-12 of the
          <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/additional-ucr-publications/ucr_handbook.pdf/at_download/file">FBI's
            Manual for UCR data</a> which details the Hierarchy Rule.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">If this data only includes the most serious crime in an incident,
        how reliable is the data? (Does the Hierarchy Rule mess up our data?)</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Though the Hierarchy Rule does mean this data is an undercount, data from other sources
          indicate it isn't much of an undercount. The FBI's other data set, the National Inicident-Based
          Reporting System (NIBRS) contains every crime that occurs in an incident (i.e. it doesn't
          use the Hierarchy Rule). Using this we can measure how many crimes the Hierarchy Rule excludes
          (Most major cities do not report to NIBRS so what we find in NIBRS may not apply to them).
          In over 90% of incidents, only one crime is committed. Additionally, when people talk about
          "crime" they usually mean murder which, while incomplete to discuss crime, means the UCR
          data here is accurate on that measure.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What about crimes not reported to the police?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>A major limitation (in my opinion the most important limitation) to the data here is that it
          doesn't include crimes not reported to police. Based on victimization surveys that ask people
          both if they were victimized and if they reported that crime, we know that the majority of
          crimes are not reported. This probably won't matter when looking at a single city for a short
          period of time - the population won't change too much so even underreporting of crime will be
          consistent underreporting. The issue becomes serious when looking at a city with major population
          changes or comparing multiple cities as their population may have very different reporting
          practices. There's no easy solution here but it is an important aspect of understanding crime
          data that you should keep in mind. For a full breakdown of reporting rates broken down by
          crime and a number of characteristics about the crime and victim (and reasons for not
          reporting), see Tables 91-105 (pages 98-114) in <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus08.pdf">
            this report on the National Crime Victmization Survey from 2008.</a></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Should I use the crime count or crime rate?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Using the rate helps deal with population changes that could lead to changes in crime merely
          because of that change but it isn't without its drawbacks. The main drawback with using a
          rate is that it assumes equal risk of victimization, which we know isn't correct. For example,
          when looking at rape, a crime that affects 6 times as many women as men (according to the
          <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv16re.pdf">2016 National Crime Victimation
            Survey Table 6, page 9</a>), yet the rate is based on total population in that city
          (the UCR does not differentiate victims by gender but other data sets, such as NIBRS
          do, allowing for better rates.). Other crimes require even more granular rates. Murder
          victims are predominantly young men, but this differs by type of murder - domestic
          violence victims are mostly women. Also, consider that population comes from those who
          live in the city and doesn't include people like tourists or people who work in that
          city but live elsewhere yet can still be victimized in the city. So while rates are
          probably better than counts as it lets you control for population, consider exactly
          who that population is, and how risk changes within that population.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What are index crimes?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Index crimes (sometimes called Part I crimes) are a collection of eight crimes often divided
          between Violent Index Crimes (murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault (assault with a
          weapon or causing serious bodily injury)) and Property Index Crimes (burglary, theft, motor
          vehicle theft, and arson (however arson is not available in this data set)). When people discuss
          "crime" they are often referring to this collection of crimes. One major drawback of this is
          that it gives equal weight to each crimes. For example, consider if New York City has 100 fewer
          murders and 100 more thefts this year than last year (and all other crimes didn't change). Their
          total index crimes would be the same but this year would be far safer than last year. For complete
          definitions of each crime, please see the FBI's <a href="https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/offenses.cfm">definitions page.</a></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why are index crimes a poor measure of crime?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The biggest problem with index crimes is that it is simply the sum of 8 (or 7 since arson data usually isn't available) crimes.
          Index crimes have a huge range in their seriousness - it includes both murder and theft.This is clearly wrong as
          100 murders is more serious than 100 thefts. This is especially a problem as less serious crimes (theft mostly) are far more
          common than more serious crimes (in 2017 there were 1.25 million violent index crimes in the United States. That same year had 5.5 million thefts.).
          So index crimes undercount the seriousness of crimes. Looking at total index crimes is, in effect, mostly just looking at theft.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is especially a problem because it hide trends in violent crimes. San Francisco, as an example, has had a huge increase in
          index crimes in the last several years. When looking closer, that increase is driven almost entirely by the near doubling of theft since 2011. During
          the same years, violent crime has stayed fairly steady. So the city isn't getting more dangerous but it appears like it is due to just looking at
          total index crimes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>While many researchers divide index crimes into violent and nonviolent categories, which helps but even this isn't entirely sufficient.
          Take Chicago as an example. It is a city infamous for its large number of murders. But as a fraction of
          index crimes, Chicago has a rounding error worth of murders. Their 653 murders in 2017 is only 0.5% of total index crimes. For violent index crimes,
          murder makes up 2.2%. What this means is that changes in murder are very difficult to detect. If Chicago had no murders this year, but a less serious crime (such as theft) increased
          slightly, we couldn't tell from looking at the number of index crimes.

      <h1>Death</h1>

      <button class="accordion">Where is the data from?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This data comes from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) WONDER data and provides
          the number of deaths for several cause of death categories for each state.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What are age-adjusted rates?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The following is the CDC's definition of age-adjusted rates from
          <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/faq.html#6">this page.</a></p>
        <blockquote>The rates of almost all causes of disease, injury, and death vary by age. Age
          adjustment is a technique for "removing" the effects of age from crude rates so as to
          allow meaningful comparisons across populations with different underlying age structures.
          For example, comparing the crude rate of heart disease in Florida with that of California
          is misleading, because the relatively older population in Florida leads to a higher crude
          death rate, even if the age-specific rates of heart disease in Florida and California were
          the same. For such a comparison, age-adjusted rates are preferable. </blockquote>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why are some values missing?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The CDC does not report death counts when there are fewer than 16 deaths in that category.
          They do this both for confidentiality of the deceased and to avoid the misuse of rates caused
          by such a small numerator.</p>
      </div>

      <h1>Police</h1>

      <button class="accordion">Where is the data from?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This data is from the FBI's Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) data which is part of the Uniform
          Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. This data provides information about how many employees (civilian and officers)
          are at a given agency. It also says how many officers were assaulted for a number of different categories of assault.</a></p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why are there no female police officers until 1971?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Prior to 1971 the data did not breakdown employees by gender. The years 1960-1970 put the number of total
          employees in the male employees column
          (and a value of 0 in the female employees column). </p>
      </div>

      <h1>Prison</h1>

      <button class="accordion">Where is the prison data from?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The three categories that say the inmate's Most Serious Charge come from the
          <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/studies/37021/datadocumentation">National
            Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP)</a> which provides data on how many people are incarcerated,
          admitted, or released from prison that year. This is divided by the most serious crime they are
          convicted of, race/ethnicity, and gender. All other categories are from the
          <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/studies/37003">National Prisoner
            Statistics (NPS)</a> data which has different information than the NCRP and more years
          available. Unlike the NCRP, the NPS has totals for the federal prison system, the state
          prison system, and the combined US as a whole. Some states and some years do not have
          information for some variables so you will likely see many missing values in this data.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Where is the population data from?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>All of the population data comes from the United States Census. For the years 2001-2016, I use
          the annual American Community Survey which is a census data set that samples 1% of the population.
          For the other years I use the decennial census and linearly impute for the years between the
          censuses. As such, please be aware that these population values are only estimates. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What is wrong with the % of population aged 18-65 data?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>I included this because most people incarcerated in prison are between these ages. However,
          not all are in these age groups meaning that this is almost certainly an over estimate. As
          such you should use the rates as estimates, NOT precise rates.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">What is the difference between custody and jurisdiction?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>As per the National Prisoner Statistics codebook, available to download <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/studies/37003">here</a></p>
        <blockquote>As states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons increased their use of local jails and interstate compacts to house inmates, NPS began
          asking states to report a count of inmates under the jurisdiction or legal authority of state and federal adult correctional officials in
          addition to their custody counts.
          Since 1977, the jurisdiction count has been the preferred measure. This count includes all state and federal inmates held in a public or
          private prison (custody) and those held in jail facilities either physically located inside or outside of the state of legal responsibility, and
          other inmates who may be temporarily out to court or in transit from the jurisdiction of legal authority to the custody of a confinement
          facility outside that jurisdiction.
          The difference between the total custody count and the jurisdiction count was small (approximately 7,000) when both were first
          collected in 1977. As more states began to report jurisdiction counts and more states began to rely on local and privately operated
          facilities to house inmates, the difference increased. At yearend 2016 the jurisdiction population totaled 1,506,800 while the custody
          population totaled 1,293,887.</blockquote>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>There are different rules for which offenses are included when an offense is committed and a disciplinary actions are taken so these categories

      <button class="accordion">Are hate crimes consistently reported?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>No, the hate crime data unwent a series of changes in how the data was collected. The crimes theft, intimidation, and vandalism/destruction of property
          only started being reported in 2009. Starting in 2014, "gender identity" was added as a possible bias motivation while in the same
          year the "ethnicity or national origin" bias motivation was split into either "ethnicity" or "national origin" bias motivations.
          This means that you should be cautious when looking at total hate crime changes as certain crimes/bias motivations were not included until recently. </p>

      <button class="accordion">Why are there no rapes before 2014?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This data set did not collect information on the number of rape, fondling, incest, or statutory rape crimes until 2014.
          Instead, it grouped rape and fondling as Sexual Offense - Forcible, and incest and statutory rape as Sexual Offense - Non-forcible.

            intimate nature with the victim. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the reporting party’s
            statement and with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction
            between the persons involved in the relationship. For the purposes of this definition—
            <ul>
              <li>Dating violence includes, but is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse.</li>
              <li>Dating violence does not include acts covered under the definition of domestic violence.</li>

      <button class="accordion">Is rate per 1,000 students a good measure?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Using rates is useful as it removes the important influence of the number of people at that school, but has its own serious limiations.
          Schools with similar number of students may still be very different in their student population and risk of victimization. Consider, for example,
          two schools which each have 20,000 students. If these two schools are very similar in students, then the rate per 1,000 students could be useful
          in comparing the schools are the groups are similar. If, however these schools differ on factors such as if the school is urban, whether students commute or
          live on campus, ages of students, etc, then knowing purely the number of students is not a very useful rate. Also consider that crimes can occur against victims
          other than students such as faculty or staff so a per 1,000 student rate would overestimate crime by decreasing the denominator. </p>
      </div>


      <button class="accordion">Are changes in crimes a reflection of actual changes in offenses, or changes in reporting?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Like all crime data, this data has a limitation as it is reported offenses only. If likelihood of reporting changes, that will
          be reflected in changes of reported offenses but we will not be able to tell (based only on this data) whether it was the number
          of crimes or the likelihood of reporting that changed. This is especially a problem with sexual offenses as they are already were
          unlikely to be reported and small changes in reporting likelihood can cause a seemingly large change in crimes reported. Also keep in mind
          that the population included (primarily college students) may have different reporting likelihoods than other populations.</p>
