      <button class="accordion">De-prosecution and death: A comment on the fatal flaws in
        Hogan (2022)
      </button>
      <div class="panel">

        <br>
        <p>In a manuscript recently accepted for publication in Criminology &
          Public Policy, Hogan (2022) presents results from a synthetic control
          method analysis that suggests de-prosecution in Philadelphia in the mid
          to late 2010s resulted in a large increase in the number of homicides
          that occurred in the city. In this comment, we point out several
          critical errors in the analysis that when corrected flip the direction
          of the effect and render the author's estimated effect null. Our primary
          concerns include the unjustified short pre-intervention period, a
          failure to correct for imbalance over covariates in the synthetic
          control models, the use of homicide counts instead of rates as an outcome,
          an inaccurate description of the data used, and an inadequate explanation
          of data cleaning procedures including missing data. We reproduce the
          author’s results after correcting for these issues and find no effect
          of de-prosecution on homicide. Thus, these flaws are fatal to the
          author’s findings and therefore the study should not be used to inform
          criminal justice policy. Considering the author’s unwillingness to share
          their data and code, we call for a greater dedication to open science
          and reproduction/replication in criminology. </p>

        <p>Past research indicates that when professional sports games are played,
          crime increases. Yet, little is known about how playoff games affect crime.
          As many criminal events associated with sports games, such as riots, occur
          during playoff games, this is an important gap in the literature. Using data
          from 15 National Hockey League (NHL) teams from 2013 through 2019, we examine
          how assault, disorder, and property crimes change when playoff games are
          played at home relative to when they are played away. We find that during
          home games there are 7\% more disorder crimes and 4\% more property crimes
          than during away games which suggests that city responses to playoff hockey
          games should prioritize crime reduction strategies to improve public safety. </p>

        <br>
        <p>What accounts for the steady decline in misdemeanour arrest rates in
           the United States following their peak in the mid-1990s? This article
           links the fluctuation in low-level law enforcement to changes in the
           budget and staffing resources cities devoted to policing. This materialist
           explanation contrasts with accounts that emphasize policy changes like
           the adoption of community policing. Dynamic panel regression analyses
           of 940 municipalities indicate low-level arrest rates declined most
           in places that reduced their police expenditure and personnel, net of
           crime and other controls. The adoption of community policing was
           unrelated to misdemeanour arrests. Findings suggest lawmakers should
           consider how increasing police budgets or police force sizes will
           likely be accompanied by increases in misdemeanour arrests and their
           attendant harms. </p>

      <button class="accordion">How Many Complaints Against Police Officers
        Can Be Abated by Incapacitating A Few "Bad Apples?"
        <p style="color: red">Criminology & Public Policy</p>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>with <a href="http://achalfin.weebly.com/">Aaron Chalfin</a></p>
        <br>
        <p>The notion that the unjustified use of force by police officers is
          concentrated amongst a few ``bad apples" is a popular descriptor
          which has gained traction in scholarly research and achieved
          considerable influence among policymakers. But is removing the
          bad apples likely to have an appreciable effect on police misconduct?
          Leveraging a simple policy simulation and data from the Chicago Police
          Department, we estimate that removing the top 10 percent of officers
          identified based on <i>ex ante</i> risk and replacing them with officers
          drawn from the middle of the risk distribution would have led to
          only a 6 percent reduction in use of force incidents in Chicago over
          a ten-year period.
          <br>
          Our analysis suggests that surgically removing predictably problematic
          police officers is unlikely to have a large impact on citizen complaints.
          By assembling some of the first empirical evidence on the likely
          magnitude of incapacitation effects, we provide critical support
          for the idea that early warning systems must be designed, above
          all, to deter problematic behavior and promote accountability.

        <p>For more than one hundred years, street lighting has been one of the
          most enduring capitalinvestments to maintain public safety. In this
          study we provide a comprehensive examination of theeffect of street
          lights on crime, by estimating the effect of nearly 300,000 street
          light outages in Chicagoneighborhoods on crime. We find that outdoor
          nighttime crimes change very little on street segments affected by
          street light outages, but that crime appears to spillover to nearby
          street segments duringthese outages. These findings suggest that
          crime may follow patterns of human activity and that the impact
          of localized street light outages can reverberate throughout
          a community. </p>

      <button class="accordion">Measuring Marginal Crime Concentration:
        A New Solution to an Old Problem
        <p style="color: red">Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency</p>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">

        </p>
        <br>
        <p> In his 2014 Sutherland address to the American Society of Criminology,
          David Weisburd demonstrated that the share of crime that is accounted for
          by the most crime-ridden street segments is notably high and strikingly
          similar across cities, an empirical regularity referred to as the ``law of crime
          concentration."Using data from three of the largest cities in the United States,
          compare observed crime
          concentration to a counterfactual distribution of crimes generated by randomizing crimes
          to street segments. We show that this method avoids a key pitfall that causes a popular
          method of measuring crime concentration to overstate the degree of crime concentration in
          a city. Most (but not all) crimes are concentrated amongst a small number of hot spots but the
          precise relationship is weaker --- sometimes considerably so --- than has been documented
          in the empirical literature. Within a city, crime is least concentrated in the neighborhoods
          that experience the largest number of crimes. The law of crime concentration sometimes holds
          only tenuously in the communities in which crimes are most prevalent. The method we propose
          is simple and easily interpretable and compliments
          recent advances which use the Gini coefficient to measure crime concentration. </p>

      <div class="panel">

        <br>
        <p>Observational evidence suggests that better ambient lighting leads people to feel safer
          when spending time outdoors in their community. We subject this finding to greater scrutiny
          and elaborate on the extent to which improvements in street lighting affect routine
          activities during nighttime hours. We report evidence from a survey experiment
          that examines individuals’ perceptions of safety under two different intensities of
          nighttime ambient lighting. Brighter street lighting leads individuals to feel
          safer and over half of survey respondents are willing to pay an additional $400 per
          year in taxes in order to finance a hypothetical program which would replace dim yellow
          street lights with brighter LED lights. However, poor lighting does not change people’s
          willingness to spend time outdoors or to engage in behaviors which mitigate risk.
          Results suggests that street lighting is a means through which policymakers
          can both control crime and improve community well-being.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Can Precision Policing Reduce Gun Violence? Evidence from “Gang Takedowns” in New York City
        <p style="color: red">Journal of Policy Analysis & Management</p>
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>with <a href="http://achalfin.weebly.com/">Aaron Chalfin</a> and

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>During the last decade, while national homicide rates have remained flat, New York City has experienced a second great crime decline, with gun violence declining by more than 50 percent since 2011. In this paper, we investigate one
          potential explanation for this dramatic and unexpected improvement in public safety - the New York Police Department's rapid shift from a policy of mass enforcement, characterized by the intensive use of street stops and field
          interrogations, to a more surgical form of "precision policing”, in which law enforcement focuses resources on a small number of individuals who are thought to be the primary drivers of violence. In anticipation of a 2013 federal court
          ruling in which the NYPD's stop and frisk practices were found to be unconstitutional, the number of official street stops made by NYPD officers declined from a high of 680,000 in 2011 to just 12,000 just five years later. During the same
          period, the NYPD dramatically increased its investment in a different tactic -- targeted enforcement actions against criminal gangs, often centered around the City’s public housing communities. In this paper, we study New York City's
          campaign of "gang takedowns" in which suspected members of criminal gangs were arrested in highly coordinated raids and prosecuted on conspiracy charges. We show that gun violence in and around public housing communities fell by
          approximately 30 percent in the first year after a gang takedown. Our estimates imply that these coordinated gang takedowns explain nearly one quarter of the decline in gun violence in New York City's public housing communities over the
          last eight years.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Door locks are an ubiquitous form of security to control access to a building with the goal of reducing crime there.
          However, research on door locks is often limited by methodological issues and primarily focuses on residential or commercial locations.
          This paper assesses the impact of card reader door locks on school buildings on an urban universitycampus. Using a
          difference-in-differences approach, this paper estimates the effect of cardreader locks on crime in buildings.
          The results indicate that the locks do not significantly affect crime within the buildings. Avenues for future research,
          including suggestions of specific universities at which to conduct further studies, are discussed.</p>

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Recent studies have found that the general public perceives forensic
          evidence to be relatively inaccurate and to involve high levels of
          human judgement. This study examines how important the general
          public finds forensic evidence by comparing decisions on
          guilt andpunishment in criminal cases that involve forensic versus
          eyewitness testimony evidence andexamining whether a CSI effect exists.
          Specifically, this experimental survey study utilized a 2
          (crime type: murder or rape) x 4 (evidence type: DNA, fingerprint,
          victim eyewitness testimony, or bystander eyewitness testimony)
          - 1 (no victim testimony for murder scenario) design, yielding seven
          vignettes scenarios to which participants were randomly assigned.
          Results indicate that forensic evidence was associated
          with more guilty verdicts and higher confidence in a guilty
          verdict. Forensic evidence did not change the expected
          sentence length and did not generally affect the ideal sentence
          length. However, for rape, respondents believed that the
          offender should receive a longer sentence when forensic evidence
          was presented but forensic evidence did not alter likely
          sentence that respondents expected the offender toreceive.
          The results of this study did not support a CSI effect.
          Overall, this study suggests that forensic evidence –
          particularly DNA – has a stronger influence during the
          verdict stage than the sentencing stage.</p>

        Does Marijuana Make Assaults Safer?

        <br>
        <p>Studies on the effect of marijuana on domestic violence often suffer from
          endogeneity issues. To examine the effect of marijuana decriminalization
          and medical marijuana legalization on serious domestic assaults, we conducted
          a difference-in-differences analysis on a panel dataset on NIBRS-reported
          assaults in 24 states over the twelve years between 2005 and 2016. Assaults
          disaggregated according to situation and extent of injury were employed as
          dependent variables. It was found that while the total number of assaults
          did not change, decriminalization reduced domestic assaults involving serious
          injuries by 18%. From a harm reduction perspective, the results suggested
          that while the extensive margin of violence did not change, the intensive
          margin measured by the seriousness of assaults were substantially affected
          by decriminalization. This result may be partially explained by reductions
          in offender alcohol intoxication and weapon-involved assault.</p>

        <p>Recent advances, especially the use of DNA technology, have revealed that faulty forensic analyses
          may have contributed to miscarriages of justice. In this study we build on recent research on the
          general public’s perceptions of the accuracy of 10 forensic science techniques and of each stage
          in the investigation process. We find that individuals in the United States hold a pessimistic
          view of the forensic science investigation process, believing that an error can occur about
          half of the time at each stage of the process. We find that respondents believe
          that forensics are far from perfect, with accuracy rates ranging from a low of 55% for voice
          analysis to a high of 83% for DNA analysis, with most techniques being considered between
          65-75% accurate. Respondents still believe that forensic evidence is a key part of a criminal
          case with nearly 40% of respondents believing that the absence of forensic evidenceis sufficient
          for a prosecutor to drop the case and that the presence of forensic evidence, even if other
          forms of evidence suggest that the defendant is not guilty, is enough to convict thedefendant.</p>

        <p>A large literature establishes that hiring police officers leads to reductions in crime and that investments
          in police are a relatively efficient means of crime control compared to investments in prisons. One concern,
          however, is that because police officers make arrests in the course of their duties, police hiring, while relatively efficient, is an inevitable driver of "mass incarceration." This research considers the dynamics through which police
          hiring affects downstream incarceration rates. Using state-level panel data as well county-level data from California, we uncover novel evidence in favor of a potentially unexpected and yet entirely intuitive result --- that investments in
          law enforcement are unlikely to markedly increase state prison populations and may even lead to a modest decrease in the number of state prisoners. As such, investments in police may, in fact, yield a "double dividend'' to society,
          by reducing incarceration rates as well as crime rates.</p>
