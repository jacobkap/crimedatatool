        <p>Recent advances, especially the use of DNA technology, have revealed that faulty forensic analyses
          may have contributed to miscarriages of justice. In this study we build on recent research on the
          general public’s perceptions of the accuracy of 10 forensic science techniques and of each stage
          in the investigation process. We find that individuals in the United States hold a pessimistic
          view of the forensic science investigation process, believing that an error can occur about
          half of the time at each stage of the process. We find that respondents believe
          that forensics are far from perfect, with accuracy rates ranging from a low of 55% for voice
          analysis to a high of 83% for DNA analysis, with most techniques being considered between
          65-75% accurate. Respondents still believe that forensic evidence is a key part of a criminal
          case with nearly 40% of respondents believing that the absence of forensic evidenceis sufficient
          for a prosecutor to drop the case and that the presence of forensic evidence, even if other
          forms of evidence suggest that the defendant is not guilty, is enough to convict thedefendant.</p>

      <button class="accordion">More Cops, Fewer Prisoners? <p style="color: red">(Criminology & Public Policy)</p></button>
      <div class="panel">

        <br>
        <p>A large literature establishes that hiring police officers leads to reductions in crime and that investments
          in police are a relatively efficient means of crime control compared to investments in prisons. One concern,
          however, is that because police officers make arrests in the course of their duties, police hiring, while relatively
          efficient, is an inevitable driver of "mass incarceration." This research considers the dynamics through which police
          hiring affects downstream incarceration rates. Using state-level panel data as well county-level data from California,
          we uncover novel evidence in favor of a potentially unexpected and yet entirely intuitive result --- that investments
          in law enforcement are unlikely to markedly increase state prison populations and may even lead to a modest decrease
          in the number of state prisoners. As such, investments in police may, in fact, yield a "double dividend'' to society,
          by reducing incarceration rates as well as crime rates.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Ambient Lighting, Use of Outdoor Spaces and Perceptions of Public Safety: Evidence from a Survey Experiment</button>
      <div class="panel">

        <br>
        <p>Observational evidence suggests that better ambient lighting leads people to feel safer
          when spending time outdoors in their community. We subject this finding to greater scrutiny
          and elaborate on the extent to which improvements in street lighting affect routine
          activities during nighttime hours. We report evidence from a survey experiment
          that examines individuals’ perceptions of safety under two different intensities of
          nighttime ambient lighting. Brighter street lighting leads individuals to feel
          safer and over half of survey respondents are willing to pay an additional $400 per
          year in taxes in order to finance a hypothetical program which would replace dim yellow
          street lights with brighter LED lights. However, poor lighting does not change people’s
          willingness to spend time outdoors or to engage in behaviors which mitigate risk.
          Results suggests that street lighting is a means through which policymakers
          can both control crime and improve community well-being.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Age, Criminal Punishment, and Accountability: What the Public Recommends for Guilty Defendants</button>

        <br>
        <p>The purpose of this paper is to assess the effect of a defendant’s age on
          public perceptions of recommended punishment, accountability, and the likelihood of
          re-offending. We use an experimental vignette design which provides a depiction
          of a violent robbery and varies the robber’s age from 15-25. Survey respondents were
          asked to recommend a prison sentence, a restitution amount, how accountable they
          believe the robber to be, and how likely he is to reoffend. Overall, there
          was no significant effect of age on recommended prison sentence but a
          significant effect $389 (p = 0.022) on recommended restitution. Female respondents
          recommended an additional 0.270 (p = 0.002) years of prison for each year of
          defendant age and no significant difference for restitution. Male respondents had
          no significant difference in recommended prison time but recommended an additional
          $500 (p = 0.017) in restitution for each year of defendant age. There was no effect
          of defendant age on accountability orreoffending. These findings have
          implications on policies that differentiate punishment by offender age, and for
          restorative justice practices given differences in preferred punishment by gender.</p>

      <button class="accordion">The Importance of Forensic Evidence on Decisions ofCriminal Guilt</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>with <a href="http://www.calstatela.edu/hhs/crim/faculty-shichun-asminet-ling-phd">Shichun (Asminet) Ling</a> and

        <br>
        <p>Recent studies have found that the general public perceives forensic
          evidence to be relatively inaccurate and to involve high levels of
          human judgement. This study examines how important the general
          public finds forensic evidence by comparing decisions on
          guilt andpunishment in criminal cases that involve forensic versus
          eyewitness testimony evidence andexamining whether a CSI effect exists.
          Specifically, this experimental survey study utilized a 2
          (crime type: murder or rape) x 4 (evidence type: DNA, fingerprint,
          victim eyewitness testimony, or bystander eyewitness testimony)
          - 1 (no victim testimony for murder scenario) design, yielding seven
          vignettes scenarios to which participants were randomly assigned.
          Results indicate that forensic evidence was associated
          with more guilty verdicts and higher confidence in a guilty
          verdict. Forensic evidence did not change the expected
          sentence length and did not generally affect the ideal sentence
          length. However, for rape, respondents believed that the
          offender should receive a longer sentence when forensic evidence
          was presented but forensic evidence did not alter likely
          sentence that respondents expected the offender toreceive.
          The results of this study did not support a CSI effect.
          Overall, this study suggests that forensic evidence –
          particularly DNA – has a stronger influence during the
          verdict stage than the sentencing stage.</p>

        <br>
        <p>For more than one hundred years, street lighting has been one of the most enduring capitalinvestments to maintain public safety.
          In this study we provide a comprehensive examination of theeffect of street lights on crime, by estimating the effect of nearly
          300,000 street light outages in Chicagoneighborhoods on crime. We find that outdoor nighttime crimes change very little on street
          segmentsaffected by street light outages, but that crime appears to spillover to nearby street segments duringthese outages.
          These findings suggest that crime may follow patterns of human activity and that theimpact of localized street light outages can
          reverberate throughout a community. </p>

      <button class="accordion">Measuring Marginal Crime Concentration: A New Solution to an Old Problem</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>with <a href="http://achalfin.weebly.com/">Aaron Chalfin</a> and
          <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/mcuellar/">Maria Cuellar</a></p>
        <br>
        <p> In his 2014 Sutherland address to the American Society of Criminology,
          David Weisburd demonstrated that the share of crime that is accounted for
          by the most crime-ridden street segments is notably high and strikingly
          similar across cities, an empirical regularity referred to as the ``law of crime
          concentration."Using data from three of the largest cities in the United States,
          compare observed crime
          concentration to a counterfactual distribution of crimes generated by randomizing crimes
          to street segments. We show that this method avoids a key pitfall that causes a popular
          method of measuring crime concentration to overstate the degree of crime concentration in
          a city. Most (but not all) crimes are concentrated amongst a small number of hot spots but the
          precise relationship is weaker --- sometimes considerably so --- than has been documented
          in the empirical literature. Within a city, crime is least concentrated in the neighborhoods
          that experience the largest number of crimes. The law of crime concentration sometimes holds
          only tenuously in the communities in which crimes are most prevalent. The method we propose
          is simple and easily interpretable and compliments
          recent advances which use the Gini coefficient to measure crime concentration. </p>

      <button class="accordion">The (In)Effectiveness of Campus Smart Locks for Reducing Crime</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>Door locks are an ubiquitous form of security to control access to a building with the goal of reducing crime there.
          However, research on door locks is often limited by methodological issues and primarily focuses on residential or commercial locations.
          This paper assesses the impact of card reader door locks on school buildings on an urban universitycampus. Using a
          difference-in-differences approach, this paper estimates the effect of cardreader locks on crime in buildings.
          The results indicate that the locks do not significantly affect crime within the buildings. Avenues for future research,
          including suggestions of specific universities at which to conduct further studies, are discussed.</p>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>with <a href="https://crim.sas.upenn.edu/people/li-sian-goh">Li Sian Goh</a></p>
        <br>
        <p>While all forms of domestic violence can be uniquely traumatizing, incidents resulting in serious injury
          can lead to lasting physical, mental, and financial consequences for the victim. Hence, it is surprising
          that most literature on the effects of policy intervention on domestic violence treats such incidents as
          homogeneous rather than considering differing levels of victim injury. This study provides evidence
          that decriminalization of marijuana leads to substantial declines in victim injury. Among domestic
          violence assaults where the victim suffered a serious injury, there was a significant decline in incidents
          where the offender was under the influence of alcohol or used a weapon.</p>

      <button class="accordion">The Effect of Moonlight on Outdoor Nighttime Crime</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <br>
        <p>The use of outdoor lighting, particularly through street lights, is a common tool for policy makers attempting
          to reduce crime. Research on the effect of lights on crime, however, are limited as installing or improving
          street lighting may affect the community in ways beyond merely increasing outdoor lighting. Welsh and Farrington’s
          (2008) study suggested that improving street lighting may also improve informal social control in the area as it
          reflects improved street usage and investments in the community. This paper uses moonlight as a unique measure
          of outdoor ambient lighting that avoids the issue of community cohesion and examines the effect of lighting directly.
          The amount of actual moonlight a city receives each night is measured using the interaction between the percent of
          the moon illuminated and the proportion of the night without clouds. This interactioncreates significant variation
          in moonlight between cities and across nights in the same city. Contrary to past research on lighting, this study
          finds that brighter nights, those with a full moon and no clouds, have significantly more crime than nights without
          any moonlight. These results suggest that there are heterogeneous effects of outdoor lighting by dosage and that
          more research on possible criminogenic effects of low dosages of outdoor lights are needed.</p>
